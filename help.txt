Geddy MVC generator generator. (Yes you've read correctly.)

Generates a geddy generator for you.

Usage:

    geddy gen gen create[name,taskRunner]

        name - Name of your generator
        taskRunner - (default = "jake")
                     Task runner the generator will use: jake, grunt, gulp, none

                     use "none" here if your task runner is not supported
                     or you prefer plain node.js instead.
